# BasicMalware
Code designed to run on a Linux computer/server in order to show how basic ransomware functions to encrypt and decrypt a person's files at command.

How the encryption file works:
  1) It takes all the files on a computer and adds them to a list (excluding the key file, the decryption file and the encryption file itself)
  2) It generates a key
  3) It runs through each file in the list, encrypting the old contents with the key and writing the encrypted contents back to the file

How the decryption file works:
  1) It takes all the files on a computer and adds them to a list ((excluding the key file, the encryption file and the decryption file itself)
  2) It opens the key files and stores the key in a variable
  3) It runs through each file in the list, decrypting the old contents with the key variable and writing the decrypted contents back to the     
original file.


The use of the OS and cryptography modules are implemented in my code.

This is how most complex malwares designed on python run. Although they are far more complex in the way they are programmed, the steps listed above are what they aim to acheive with their complex code.
